   Zero to IPSec in 4 minutes

   This short article looks at how to get a fully functional IPSec VPN up
   and running between two fresh OpenBSD installations in about four
   minutes flat.
   Until recently, setting up an open-source IPSec solution has been
   woefully complex and involved wading through an alphabet soup of
   committee-designed protocols. Many people give up on IPSec after their
   first peek at the horrible and complex software documentation, opting
   instead to install some sort of commercial SSL VPN which seems much
   simpler. For those who have been through this exercise, a jumble of
   SAs, ESPs, AHs, SPIs, CAs, certs, FIFOs, IKEs and policy jargon inside
   RFCs is enough to give anyone a headache. However, there is good new
   on the IPSec front: it has all finally been covered up with a nice,
   simple way to set it up under [42]OpenBSD.

   In this short article we'll look at how to get a fully functional
   IPSec VPN up and running between two fresh OpenBSD machines in about
   four minutes flat. The goal here certainly isn't to give an exhaustive
   overview of all the option available in IPSec or OpenBSD, but rather
   just how quickly and easily we can be up and running when others take
   days or weeks to do the same thing.

Introducing ipsecctl in OpenBSD

   You might not have noticed it, but a new command has sneaked into
   OpenBSD, starting with version 3.8: [43]ipsecctl. And it's truly
   wonderful. It provides a much needed layer of abstraction to all the
   highly flexible, but horribly intricate details of IPSec. In reality,
   most people don't need half the configuration and protocol options
   that IPSec provides, so this abstraction layer is sorely needed.

   If all one wants to do is set up a simple encrypted Virtual Private
   Network (VPN) between two sites, the configuration steps one would
   have to go through otherwise were always truly ugly, and a bottle of
   aspirin was a mandatory accessory. No more! Now with ipsecctl, a
   simple VPN can be setup by editing one simple configuration file on
   OpenBSD: /etc/ipsec.conf.

   As a test, my colleague Sean Comeau and I took two freshly installed
   OpenBSD firewalls, in their default configurations, and edited three
   files. We changed a total of seven lines of configuration on each
   system - and had an IPSec VPN exchanging packets between our two sites
   within four minutes of the first boot.

   Those who haven't installed OpenBSD before will find [44]the
   installation process surprisingly easy. The two most popular ways of
   installing are via CD-ROM (an inexpensive option, but it must be
   purchased from the OpenBSD team), or via a simple FTP install using a
   floppy or CD-ROM boot media. With a broadband connection, a complete
   FTP install of a default system can easily be completed in under ten
   minutes. For the purpose of this article, we'll assume you have two
   fresh installs of OpenBSD ready to go. Note that if you follow the
   [45]CVS builds of either OpenBSD 3.8-stable or OpenBSD 3.8-current,
   both machines in your VPN should be running the same snapshot.

An IPSec example

   To illustrate just how simple IPSec is to setup in OpenBSD, let's
   start with an example. First, let's quickly review our goals. We want
   to network two remote subnets via a fully encrypted, standard IPSec
   Virtual Private Network (VPN). Both our subnets will have OpenBSD
   Network Address Translation (NAT) firewalls.

   Network A:

   External IP address: 1.2.3.4 Internal IP address block: 10.1.1.0/24

   Network B:

   External IP address: 5.6.7.8 Internal IP address block: 10.2.2.0/24

   The [46]configuration of pf, which is our firewall and provides NAT,
   is found /etc/pf.conf. On both systems in this example, [47]pf.conf
   should look as follows:

ext_if="fxp0"
int_if="fxp1"
set skip on { lo $int_if }
nat on $ext_if from !($ext_if) -> ($ext_if:0)
block in
pass out keep state

   Both systems have had IP forwarding turned on by uncommenting the
   "net.inet.ip.forwarding=1" line in the /etc/sysctl.conf file. IP
   forwarding is turned off by default, but is required for NAT. Now that
   we understand our objectives and have two fully functional base
   systems, what do we have to do to link our two internal subnets
   together with a VPN? As you will see, the configuration is
   surprisingly simple.

Step 1. Configure IPSec

   First, add the following lines to Firewall A in /etc/ipsec.conf:

ike esp from 10.1.1.0/24 to 10.2.2.0/24 peer 5.6.7.8
ike esp from 1.2.3.4 to 10.2.2.0/24 peer 5.6.7.8
ike esp from 1.2.3.4 to 5.6.7.8

   Next, add the following lines to Firewall B's /etc/ipsec.conf:

ike passive esp from 10.2.2.0/24 to 10.1.1.0/24 peer 1.2.3.4
ike passive esp from 5.6.7.8 to 10.1.1.0/24 peer 1.2.3.4
ike passive esp from 5.6.7.8 to 1.2.3.4

   The passive modifier in the configuration denotes that Firewall A will
   initiate the connection and Firewall B will listen for it.

Step 2. Allow IPSec through the firewall

   Now, add the following line to /etc/pf.conf to configure the firewall
   on Firewall A:

pass quick on $ext_if from 5.6.7.8

   and change the "set skip" line from:

set skip on { lo $int_if }

   to:

set skip on { lo $int_if enc0 }

   This adds the encapsulated enc0 interface to the list.

   Now let's move on to Firewall B. In this /etc/pf.conf, add the
   following lines:

pass quick on $ext_if  from 1.2.3.4
set skip on { lo $int_if enc0 }

   We're done with both the firewall/NAT and IPSec configiguration, so
   let's move on to the next step - copying the keys.

Step 3. Copy the isakmpd keys to each system

   On Firewall A (1.2.3.4), copy /etc/isakmpd/private/local.pub from
   Firewall B into /etc/isakmpd/pubkeys/ipv4/5.6.7.8.

   Similarly, on Firewall B (5.6.7.8) copy /etc/isakmpd/private/local.pub
   from Firewall A into /etc/isakmpd/pubkeys/ipv4/1.2.3.4.

   The reader should note that while this configuration uses numeric IP
   addresses, the configuration can also be done with fully qualified
   domain names. To use domain names, simply copy the keys into the
   /etc/isakmpd/pubkeys/fqdn directory, and use srcid and dstid keywords
   in you /etc/ipsec.conf flow specifications.

Step 4. Start the VPN

   To start the VPN, use the following commands on both systems:

isakmpd -K
ipsecctl -f /etc/ipsec.conf

   Congratualtions! You've just set up an IPSec VPN. You should be
   pleased to know that the ipsecctl command has automatically configured
   isakmpd and all its horrible config files, and it has chosen nice,
   sensible, and secure defaults for you.

   The -K option tells isakmpd to skip the intricate and rarely needed
   policy configurations that would otherwise be required.

   Now let's test the VPN. You should be able to ping nodes on 10.2.2.*
   from nodes on 10.1.1.* and vice versa. If this doesn't work, try
   starting up isakmpd with the debug option "isakmpd -K -d" to get more
   diagnostics.

Step 5. Set this up to start automatically at reboot

   The default startup daemons on OpenBSD are found in the standard
   rc.conf file. Edit /etc/rc.conf and change the isakmpd line to:

isakmpd="-K"

   Also ensure that 'PF=YES' in rc.conf as well, so that your pf
   firewall/NAT is started at the next boot. Now we also want to ensure
   that ipsecctl is started automatically. To the /etc/rc.local file, add
   the following line:

ipsecctl -f /etc/ipsec.conf

   Finally, you may wish to edit your /etc/changelist on both Firewall A
   and B to ensure that your new /etc/ipsec.conf configuration file is
   listed. While this step is entirely optional, it ensures that any
   changes to your IPSec configuration be tracked and emailed to the
   administrator on a daily basis, as part of the daily mail script. For
   this to work, you must have configured /etc/mail/aliases and have
   given the root alias your own email address, and then run 'newaliases'
   to commit the changes.

   And there you have it. Isn't that nice and simple? If you are familiar
   with pf and pfctl, ipsecctl will seem very easy and provides a very
   similar interface. In other words, you can get the status of the ipsec
   flows and associations with:

ipsecctl -sa

   And so on. Amazingly, it took more than a decade for someone to
   finally provide a simple, straightforward configuration interface to
   IPSec. It's now simple enough that we are finally able to recommend
   IPSec to novice people so they can easily setup an IPSec VPN.

Conclusion

   In this short article we looked at how easy it is to setup an IPSec
   VPN between two fresh OpenBSD installations. We started with two
   default installations and changed a total of seven configuration
   lines. Instead of taking days or weeks to get an IPSec VPN up and
   running, ours was running in about four minutes.

   Thanks Theo and the OpenBSD team for this, as we believe this is truly
   a huge step forward for users everywhere who want to use IPSec.
   Ipsecctl is what we have long needed.

   As a personal note, I'd like to see other *BSD committers port this to
   many other systems. Ipsecctl was specified by Matt Sauve-Frankel, and
   coded by Hans-Joerg Hoexer. While ipsecctl doesn't appear to work
   fully with IPv6 yet, support for this should be on the way. Also note
   that there may be differences with how ipsecctl works on the CVS
   versions of 3.8-current and 3.8-stable, and therefore it is
   recommended that both firewalls in your IPSec configuration run the
   same version of OpenBSD.
